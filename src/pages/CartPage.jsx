/**
 * CartPage.jsx
 *
 * Placeholder page for the shopping cart.
 *
 * CURRENT FUNCTIONALITY:
 * - Displays a simple message indicating the cart feature is under development.

 * FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
 * - Display a list of items added to the cart with details such as product name, size, quantity, and price.
 * - Allow users to update quantities and remove items from the cart.
 * - Show cart subtotal and total prices.
 * - Integrate with backend or persistent storage for saving cart state.
 * - Improve UI/UX with responsive design and accessibility considerations.
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTES:
 * - Currently a static placeholder to maintain routing structure.
 * - Will require CartContext and CartProvider integration for full functionality.
